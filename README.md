# mjml gulp browsersync startup


Welcome to my start-up kit for creating MJML emails with Gulp and BrowserSync. The purpose is to create a coding environment where I can update MJML files and they automatically compile into HTML while the browser updates. Less time hitting the browser's reload button, the better. 

There are several MJML browser applications out there, however, I want to create my own set-up just in case.

Included in this project are the following:


	• gulp: 4.0.2
    • gulp-mjml: 4.0.2
    • mjml-cli: 4.13.0
    • browser-sync: 2.27.10
  	• gulp-imagemin: 7.1.0

Install them by typing:

```npm intall```




When starting a new email project type:

```npm run start```


When it's time to build the email into production type:

```npm run build```
 


Thanks for visiting and happy coding.

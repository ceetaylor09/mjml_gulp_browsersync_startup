# mjml gulp browsersync startup


Welcome to my start-up kit for creating MJML emails with Gulp and BrowserSync. The purpse is to create a development environment where I can update MJML files and they automatically compile into HTML, while the browser updates just by pressing "Command (or Control) + s". 

There are MJML browser apps out there, however, I want to create my own set-up just in case.

Included in this project are the following:


	• gulp: 4.0.2
    • gulp-mjml: 4.0.2
    • mjml-cli: 4.13.0
    • browser-sync: 2.27.10
  	• gulp-imagemin: 7.1.0


When starting a new email project type:
"npm run start" 

When it's time to build the email into production type:
"npm run build" 


Thanks and happy coding.
